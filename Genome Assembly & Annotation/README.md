# Genome Assembly & Annotation

This section covers graph-based genome assembly: how reads/k-mers form graphs and how paths through those graphs reconstruct genomes. It’s focused on clear, interview-friendly implementations and intuition.

## What’s inside
- **graph_assembly/** — de Bruijn graphs, Eulerian paths/cycles, string reconstruction, k-universal strings.

_All scripts are pure Python; usage and examples live in each subfolder README._
