# Read Mapping & Variant Calling

A minimal, practical path from reference indexing and seeding to read alignment and consensus/variant output. Emphasis is on clarity over completeness so you can explain each step crisply.

## What’s inside
- **read_mapping/** — seed-and-extend components (index ideas, seeding, extension/alignment).
- **viral_consensus/** — a tiny consensus builder from mapped reads with straightforward rules.

_Details and examples are in each subfolder README._
