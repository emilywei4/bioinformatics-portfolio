# Bioinformatics Portfolio

This portfolio showcases a collection of bioinformatics problems solved during my training in Bioinformatics at UC San Diego, a program that emphasized applied computational analysis and real-world genomics workflows. Each section focuses on a specific analytical challenge, ranging from sequence parsing to phylogenetic inference, and demonstrates practical problem-solving skills using modern bioinformatics tools and Python-based workflows.

## Project Areas

### Sequence Parsing & QC
Workflows for reading and analyzing FASTA/FASTQ data, computing GC content, k-mer frequencies, and quality control of short-read data.

### Genome Assembly & Annotation
Implementations of read trimming, de novo assembly, and gene prediction using tools like SPAdes, QUAST, and Prodigal.

### Read Mapping & Variant Calling
End-to-end pipelines for mapping paired-end reads, generating alignment statistics, constructing consensus sequences, and calling SNVs/indels.

### Multiple Sequence Alignment & Phylogenetics
Practical exercises in multiple sequence alignment (MAFFT, ViralMSA) and phylogenetic inference (FastTree, IQ-TREE, RAxML-NG), including Python-based tree traversal and visualization.

### Pairwise Genetic Distance & Clustering
Workflows for computing pairwise genetic distances (TN93) and performing sequence clustering and visualization to explore genetic similarity and evolutionary patterns.
