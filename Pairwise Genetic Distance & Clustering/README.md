# Pairwise Genetic Distance & Clustering

Compact tools for comparing genomes and grouping data. Rearrangement distance captures large-scale genome edits; k-means covers unsupervised clustering basics you can quickly derive on a whiteboard.

## What’s inside
- **genome_rearrangements/** — greedy sorting of signed permutations, breakpoint count, two-break distance via breakpoint graphs.
- **kmeans_clustering_basics/** — farthest-first seeding, squared-error distortion, and Lloyd’s k-means loop.
- **genetic_distance_clustering/** — utilities around distance matrices and simple clustering workflows.

_Subfolder READMEs include short code snippets you can run as refreshers._
